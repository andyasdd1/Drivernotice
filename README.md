# Drivernotice
In this program I utilized using the observer pattern. It can easliy pass through message from management to observers.
Shop, driver and management are separated into different classes with there own interfaces, this allow futrue implementation to 
be flexible and fast.
I include setters and getters for drivers, I also include two different list of Deliveryquest for drivers, this can make sure people don't get confused about what's what inside the driver classes.
I have avoided duplicated code as there's none complex code for the program, everything is separated nicely.
